    <p> Jared Erondu is the head of Design Lattice, where he is working on HR software along with his other two projects High Resolution and Playbook. He has
    a very diverse background having lived across the world in North America, South America, and Scandinavia while growing up. One thing about Jared Erondu that 
    intially drew my interest to having him as my tech hero is the fact that his passion in his work is directed towards advancing the community. Many of his 
    projects are centered around devleopment in careers in the design community. More recently, Erondu has raised awareness for the social injustice in our society
    by promoting the Black Lives Matter Movement along with a push for change in the Design Lattice community to combat racial injustice. Lastly, he has pushed for 
    American's to take action on their rights and go out and vote! This is something that everyone needs to take responsibility and do for the future of our nation.</p>

    <h2> How Jared Erondu Supports Action in Design: </h2>
    <p> "Good design is inclusive: To solve problems in ways that work for as many people as possible, we need diverse perspectives. In the face of recent U.S. 
      political events that impinge on civil rights, we donâ€™t have the luxury of being apolitical. Taking action starts with deciding where and how to focus 
      our energy and talents as designers" (askplaybook.com). </p>
