    <p> Jared Erondu is the head of Design Lattice, where he is working on HR software along with his other two projects
      High Resolution and Playbook. He has
      a very diverse background having lived across the world in North America, South America, and Scandinavia while
      growing up. One thing about Jared Erondu that
      intially drew my interest to having him as my tech hero is the fact that his passion in his work is directed
      towards
      advancing the community. Many of his
      projects are centered around devleopment in careers in the design community. More recently, Erondu has raised
      awareness for the social injustice in our society
      by promoting the Black Lives Matter Movement along with a push for change in the Design Lattice community to
      combat
      racial injustice. Lastly, he has pushed for
      American's to take action on their rights and go out and vote! This is something that everyone needs to take
      responsibility and do for the future of our nation.</p>

    <h2> How Jared Erondu Supports Action in Design: </h2>
    <p> "Good design is inclusive: To solve problems in ways that work for as many people as possible, we need diverse
      perspectives. In the face of recent U.S.
      political events that impinge on civil rights, we donâ€™t have the luxury of being apolitical. Taking action starts
      with deciding where and how to focus
      our energy and talents as designers" (askplaybook.com). </p>
