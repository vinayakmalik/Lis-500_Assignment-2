    <p>Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American inventor, actress and film producer. Hedy Lamarr's life was adventurous. As
      an actress and film producer, she was one of the most successful stars at that time. As an inventor in technology
      field, Hedy is the inventor of FHSS (Frequency-hopping spread spectrum) technology: FHSS is the building block of
      CDMA (Code-division multiple access) communication technology, which is the foundation of Wi-Fi, bluetooth, 4G,
      5G...

      The FHSS technology invented by Hedy is one of the most important inventions during 20th century and one of the
      most utilized technology in 21st century. She was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014 based
      on the value of her work. Hedy Lamarr's story is inspiring to me and that's why I chose her as my tech hero.
