    My name is Alyssa Gromala and I am a Senior majoring in Biology on a Pre-health track. My previous history in code and power is rather brief, but I 
    did take a course last semester that first introduced me to coding which was LIS 351. I plan on graduating in Spring 2021 and taking a gap year before I
    start medical school. My hobbies include golfing as I am on women's golf team and working out.

    <h2>How did you interview your partner?</h2>
    <p>The interview with Vinayak was wonderful, it was great to meet someone new in this class with a background in Digital Science that is much different
        than many of my other classmates I usually interact with. We were able to successfully work together and used Zoom record to create a video for the 
        assignment. I have not had the opportunity to interview Michael yet, but I was able to watch his video introduction and glad to include him in our 
        group for this assignment.</p>
    <h2>What issues did you face?</h2>
    <p>Initially we were struggling with figuring out how to record our interview, but after trying Zoom we figured that it would be the best method to record
      and later edit our video. Additonally, it took some discussion time between us to figure out the order in which we were going to discuss our interview topics.
