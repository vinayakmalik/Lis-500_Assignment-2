      <p>
        My name is Alyssa Gromala and I am a Senior majoring in Biology on a Pre-health track. My previous history in
        code and power is rather brief, but I
        did take a course last semester that first introduced me to coding which was LIS 351. I plan on graduating in
        Spring 2021 and taking a gap year before I
        start medical school. My hobbies include golfing as I am on women's golf team and working out.

      <h2>How did you interview your partner?</h2>
      <p>The interview with Vinayak was wonderful, it was great to meet someone new in this class with a background in
        Digital Science that is much different
        than many of my other classmates I usually interact with. We were able to successfully work together and used
        Zoom record to create a video for the
        assignment. I have not had the opportunity to interview Michael yet, but I was able to watch his video
        introduction and glad to include him in our
        group for this assignment.</p>
      <h2>What issues did you face?</h2>
      <p>Initially we were struggling with figuring out how to record our interview, but after trying Zoom we figured
        that it would be the best method to record
        and later edit our video. Additionally, it took some discussion time between us to figure out the order in which
        we were going to discuss our interview topics.

      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>Hey There! My name is Vinayak Malik and I am a Senior majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a Minor in Digital Studies. I am a an avid coder and enjoy the challenge of coding new things on a daily bases. I have some Web Development experience, both through taking classes as well as internships . I plan on graduating in Fall 2021 and I am still unsure about whether I want to work for a few years and then try getting a masters's degree or to just apply to grad school right after graduation. My hobbies include Reading books, playing the harmonica, rugby as well as partaking in a lot of online games.
      </p>
      <h2>How did you interview your partner?</h2>
      <p>It was fun getting to know Alyssa, since she is from a completely different background then I am from. She is also one of the very few people that I know of who play golf and that to professionally. We were able to collaborate together successfully and discuss openly about a lot of issues. As for Michael I didn't get a chance to talk to him since he was not a part of our group before but I have watched his intro video and am happy to welcome a fellow Computer Science Major to the group! </p>
      <h2>What issues did you face?</h2>
      <p>
        we faced some tech issues initially, since we could'nt figure out what software to use to record our video, but then after a few trial and errors we settled on zoom, apart from that we spent some time trying to figure out what to say in the interview and to make the video sound like an interview and not a recorded leture, we also faced some issus with editing the video since it exceeded the given time limit.
